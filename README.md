# HALLOWEENCTF@UHS-CS-CLUB
This is a really small and simple CTF made for the UHS CS Club 2025 Halloween Event!
It is very beginner-friendly and introduces a few new concepts! It's also a ton of fun and themed as well!

## How to run
Run the following command in your Command Prompt or Bash when in the same folder as `console.py`

Make sure you have Python installed!
```
python console.py
```
Should be pretty self-explanatory from there!

## Tips
- Read the code super thoroughly!
- Google is your friend
- There are some hints as comments in the code

## Rules
- You CANNOT modify the code AT ALL!!!
- ABSOLUTELY NO USE of a debugger!!!
- If you are REALLY stuck, ask your peers or an exec for help!

# Good Luck!
