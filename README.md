# 🎃 HALLOWEENCTF@UHS-CS-CLUB

Welcome to the UHS CS Club 2025 Halloween CTF Event!

This is a beginner-friendly Capture The Flag challenge where you've been trapped in a sinister mansion. You must escape before dawn by unlocking 4 locks and solving puzzles along the way!

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Make sure Python is installed
- You need Python 3.x on your computer
- Test if it's installed by opening Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux) and typing:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

### Step 2: Download the files
- Make sure all `.py` files are in the same folder

### Step 3: Navigate to the folder
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal
- Use `cd` to go to the folder with the files:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/folder
  ```

### Step 4: Run the program
```bash
python console.py
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
python3 console.py
```

## 🎯 Your Mission

You need to unlock **4 locks** to escape the mansion:

1. **Choose a lock** (1-4) when prompted by the MOS system
2. **Figure out the password** for that lock
3. **Get the lock code** after entering the correct password
4. **Repeat for all 4 locks** to collect all codes
5. **Escape!**

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Read the code super thoroughly!** - Open the `.py` files in a text editor
- **Google is your friend** - Look up things like "base64 decoder" or "python functions"
- **Look for hints in comments** - The code has helpful comments from the character's perspective
- **Take notes** - Write down lock codes as you find them
- **Start with Lock 1** - It's the easiest and builds up from there
- **Think outside the box** - Not everything works as expected...
- **Errors can be useful** - Sometimes breaking things is part of the solution 😉

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- Reading and understanding Python code
- Base64 encoding/decoding
- String manipulation and algorithms  
- Buffer overflow concepts (simulated safely)
- Basic reverse engineering techniques

## ⚠️ Rules

- ❌ You **CANNOT modify the code AT ALL!!!**
- ❌ **ABSOLUTELY NO USE of a debugger!!!**
- ✅ If you are **REALLY stuck**, ask your peers or an exec for help!
- ✅ You CAN use online tools and Google searches

## 🆘 Getting Stuck?

Don't worry! This is designed for beginners. If you're stuck:
1. Re-read the code comments carefully
2. Try Googling unfamiliar terms or functions
3. Ask a friend or exec for a hint
4. Remember: sometimes the answer is right in front of you!
